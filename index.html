                        &nbsp; I have a wide variety of field work experiences. 
                        My latest experience was in Pınar Et, 
                        which I’ve worked as an IT Support Intern and I improved my team working skills as well as learning work flows in an industrial standardized facility. 
                        Before that, I’ve worked at Atik Bilişim, which I worked as a Part-Time Salesman. 
                        Being a salesman as a starting point on my career: 
                        I get to know more information about tools used in IT field as well as learning about use cases & needs from customers. 
                        Additionally, I learned about customer relationships. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp; Speaking of learning and knowledge, I also have verified certificates, 
                        on Python: from Harvard(CS50), which is given after 9 weeks of problemsets and 1 final project. 
                        Additionally on teaching: “Usta Öğreticilik Belgesi”, 
                        that allows me to teach students in my field, which is given by government agency after I completed required courses and passed the final exams.
